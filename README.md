# MyEmptyPortfolio
I'm just a would-be programmer now, so I should have my own empty portfolio.

My intention was to create a portfolio website that looks like a terminal. A content of specific subpages, are called with appropriate commands. The website will be in two language versions, Polish and English, it will also have a version with a more classic design.
